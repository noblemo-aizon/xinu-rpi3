 * @brief The SoC of the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ is the Broadcom BCM2837B0.
 *
 * While much of Embedded Xinu's port has been redesigned for the BCM2837B0 (bootloader, multicore capability, L1 cache, to name a few), there are remnants of the last port (BCM2835 Raspberry Pi 1) in this operating system as the entire wheel need not be reinvented.
